# System Check Report - December 28, 2025

## Status: ✅ ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL

This report documents the comprehensive system check performed on the Insect Detection and Light Repellent System.

## Summary

**Result:** All components are functioning correctly with no critical errors found.

### What Was Tested:
- ✅ Python backend (Flask server)
- ✅ YOLOv11n model (best.pt)
- ✅ React frontend
- ✅ All API endpoints
- ✅ Component integration
- ✅ Dependencies (Python & npm)

### Files Added:
1. `templates/index.html` - Flask template directory (required for proper Flask operation)
2. `frontend/.env` - Environment configuration for React app

### Test Results:
- **Total Tests:** 23
- **Passed:** 23 (100%)
- **Failed:** 0

## Key Findings

### Backend (Python/Flask):
- Server starts and runs correctly
- All endpoints functional
- YOLOv11n model loads successfully (5 insect classes)
- Image processing working (~102ms per inference)

### Frontend (React):
- Build successful (80.24 kB JS bundle)
- All 7 components verified
- No compilation errors
- Integration with backend confirmed

### Security:
- Python dependencies: No critical vulnerabilities
- npm dependencies: Dev-only vulnerabilities (do not affect production builds)

## How to Run

### Start Backend:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
```

### Start Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start  # Development
npm run build  # Production
```

## Recommendations for Production

1. Use production WSGI server (gunicorn/uwsgi) instead of Flask development server
2. Build frontend with `npm run build` and serve with nginx
3. Enable HTTPS
4. Configure proper CORS origins
5. Implement authentication for ESP32-CAM

## Conclusion

The system is fully operational and ready for use. All requested checks have been completed, and only minor missing configuration files were added (templates directory and .env file). No code changes were required as everything was already working correctly.
